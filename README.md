# *** Do not use this on your main account ***
# Starting the game with UEVR:

1. Download the [UEVR](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR/releases) mod if you don't have it.

3. Download this [dinput8.dll](https://github.com/mirudo2/BP-UEVR/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

4. Create a folder called "NativeMods" under "C:\" ("C:\NativeMods").

5. Move the "UEVRBackend.dll" dll to the "NativeMods" folder.

6. Lastly, move the 3 dlls (dinput8.dll, UEVRBackend.dll and openxr_loader.dll) to the game folder, that is: "*:\Blue Protocol\Game\BLUEPROTOCOL\BLUEPROTOCOL\Binaries\Win64".

# You must know that you will need a VPN to play this game, after installing the VPN select the country Japan and activate the VPN.

When creating your account, choose the continent "Asia" and select "Japan" as your country.

Important: during the game installation, uncheck the launcher's automatic startup checkbox when starting Windows.

This checkbox is also present in the launcher configuration.

That's all, now you can start the game normally from the launcher.

Note, it is not possible to use the translation mod together with UEVR, because they both use the dll "dinput8.dll", but they are different dlls.
